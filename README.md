Pros and Cons of TDD:
Pros: It gives more assurance that there is no bug in the code. In case there is, it is quite helpful to detect where the bug is from
Cons: It takes a good amount of time to write the tests. It is also possible that the occurred bug is not from the code, but from how you have written the test
